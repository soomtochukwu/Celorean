## Milestone 1 — Network Compatibility Stabilization (2025-09-07)

- Commit: 54e2b510 (2025-09-07)
- Original message: "FIX: wallet/network compatibility"

### Key updates
- Smart contract and deployment infrastructure:
  - Updated contract references and address registries to align per-network usage: Smartcontract/addresses (root and localhost variants), ensuring the DApp reads the correct addresses per environment.
  - Deployment and upgrade scripts refined (scripts/deploy.ts, scripts/upgrade.ts) for more reliable network detection and usage.
  - Package and Hardhat-side adjustments to support predictable builds and deployment tasks.
- Frontend compatibility and UX resiliency:
  - Provider configuration and app providers updated to gracefully handle network mismatches and wallet differences (frontend/app/providers.tsx).
  - Introduced/updated NetworkContext and a network switcher component to let users align their wallet with the selected chain (frontend/contexts/NetworkContext.tsx, frontend/components/network-switcher.tsx).
  - Centralized address consumption (frontend/contracts/addresses.ts, index.ts) to ensure contract calls always target the correct network deployment.
  - Added network error handling utility (frontend/utils/network-error-handler.ts) and related hooks (useNetworkManager, useCeloreanContract) to reduce user-facing errors on wrong networks or unsupported chains.

### Impact
- Reduced connection friction between wallet and app.
- Consistent per-network contract address resolution.
- More resilient dApp behavior across different wallets and networks.

## Milestone 2 — Environment Selection & Learning/Credentials Overhaul (2025-09-11)

- Commit: b144b973 (2025-09-11)
- Original message: "FEAT: modify FE to  specify testnet/mainnet/localhost, Proper dev-flow, community under dev., added credenetials page, learning page undergoing critical changes, etc"

### Key updates
- Environment selection and dev-flow:
  - Explicit support for selecting testnet/mainnet/localhost in the frontend.
  - Improvements to app layout and providers to propagate environment settings.
- Learning and dashboard experience:
  - Significant updates across pages: course details, dashboard, achievements, learning page.
  - Course components and hooks revised to improve data loading and error boundaries.
- Credentials workflows:
  - Added Credentials page and API routes for issuing, listing, and verifying credentials (frontend/app/api/credentials/*).
- Community features (under development):
  - Introduced a community page and seed data for community messages (frontend/.data/community-messages.json).
- Contract integration and addresses:
  - Updated ABI (frontend/contracts/Celorean.json) and per-network address registries to match new deployments.
  - Hooks (useCeloreanContract, useCourses, useNetworkManager) aligned to new flows and environment selection.

### Impact
- Clearer environment targeting (dev/testnet/mainnet) for both developers and users.
- Foundations for credentials issuance/verification and community interactions.
- Improved learning flow and app robustness through updated components and error handling.

## Milestone 3 — Deployment Outputs & Dev Seeding Improvements (2025-09-11)

- Commit: 7d029f0b (2025-09-11)
- Original message: "FIX: modified deploy scripts to output proxy contract detials depending on the network is was deployed on: FIX: deploy script seeds smc in dev mode, etc"

### Key updates
- Deployment pipeline
  - Deployment script prints proxy and implementation details tailored to the active network (Smartcontract/scripts/deploy.ts).
  - Address syncing utility and outputs improved (Smartcontract/scripts/sync-addresses.ts, Smartcontract/addresses/*) to keep frontend and scripts in sync.
  - Upgrade script refined to coexist with proxy deployments.
- Dev environment data seeding
  - Automated dev-mode seeding of smart contract state to accelerate local testing and feature verification.
- Contract and config alignment
  - Minor refinements in core contracts and modules (Celorean.sol, CourseModule.sol, CredentialModule.sol) and Hardhat config to support the enhanced deploy flow.

### Impact
- Easier verification of deployments and proxies across networks.
- Faster developer onboarding with pre-seeded local environments.
- Tighter alignment between on-chain artifacts and frontend consumption.
